### Introduction

Over the past several months, I have been doing Capture the Flags challenges on [Cryptohack](https://cryptohack.org). Cryptohack is a platform for learning practical cryptography with game-like challenges. I love the platform, because it doesn't require you to leetcode the solution with the best Big-O time complexity. Instead, you just need to get the flag any way possible.



### XOR and Symmetric Encryption

XOR is one of those bit operators that escapes the mainstream spotlight. It's not a fancy framework or language making its way through the industry, but XOR is a fundamental part of what makes the internet and our software safe. Before we dive into code examples, we should cover what XOR is and how it's used.
